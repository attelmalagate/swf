<h2>Why another web application framework?</h2>
<p>
While the world certainly does not need yet another framework to develop web
applications, I created this one for my own education and personal needs, which are 
fairly limited. A cursory search of available solutions returns a confusing list of 
tools of inequal complexity or usefulness (to me), and rather than spend time learning
one of these tools, I decided to invest an equivalent ammount of effort in developing
a taylor-made solution exactly adapted to my needs - no more, no less. This approach 
provides the additional benefit of re-acquaiting myself with the underlying 
technologies and their evolutions since I last professionnally coded (2005).

It is true that by shunning sophisticated frameworks, one is missing out on well tested 
functionalities, some critical (like authentication, or session management), but there are 
behind this conscious decision key design principles: 
</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0">
	<li>avoid clutter</li>
	<li>do not use existing frameworks before having developed a rationale behind the choice of a specific solution,
		as well as a minimum understanding of how they work
	</li>
	<li>develop and design by (testable) increments: development is not unlike evolution by natural selection
		except that in our case, random mutations are replaced by (hopefully) educated
		coding decisions, and natural selection by the usability of an application. I do not believe
		in lenghty design and coding phases without multiple interim, testable versions,
		demonstrating every step of the way what works and what does not. Otherwise, you invariably end up
		with an indigestible bowl of spaghetti, impossible to debug and maintain.
	</li>
	<li>embrace refactoring; many developers tend to avoid refactoring because they are afraid of breaking
	beyond repair their existing codebase: this is a sign of weakness. Professional developers embrace changes
	when changes are needed because they are in total control of their code base and of their tools.
	</li>
</ul>

Current requirements and specs are detailed below:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0">
	<li>single page application with header, footer, main panel with tabs, menu and optional side navigation panel</li>
	<li>additional components</li>
		<ul>
			<li>editable table</li>
			<li>justified gallery for photos and pictures, witch checkable images and a lightbox view</li>
		</ul>
	<li>client side javascript</li>
</ul>
They will certainly evolve with time and new needs, including
server side functions to manage more sophisticated requirements (like authentication, localization) but the current
objective was to put together a barebone framework to quickly develop simple applications like this
